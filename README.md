# Rhythm #

Rhythm is a nonverbal behavior annotator for virtual characters: given
text, it will generate appropriate nonverbal behavior for that text,
including eye movement, head movement, hand gestures, and postural changes.
The resulting annotated text can be used as a basis for hand-edited 
animation scripts, or could be directly given to character animation.
Rhythm can be seen as a clean reimplementation of earlier academic
projects, primarily [BEAT](www.ru.is/faculty/hannes/beat/).

It is currently in an embryonic state, so do not expect it to do much
at the moment.
